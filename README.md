# Professional Portfolio: Darrin Scott Hunter (version 1.0)
* [SEE THE DEPLOYED APPLICATION HERE](https://dishdesigner.github.io/professional-portfolio)
---

## Description

* This application is a simple one-page website for my own digital design and coding portfolio.
* It is intended to grow as I have more projects to share in the future, so some content shown here is merely placeholder content, or it links to an existing website with my professional graphic design and photography work.
* Next steps in the evolution of this portfolio website would be:
    - to add more work product as it comes online
    - to continue to evolve the functional & aesthetic UI as my coding skills improve
    - to add back-end full stack administration infrastructure
    - to increase accessible options to a mostly visual experience when possible
    - to add evidence of thorough testing across all viewing devices
    - to explore seamless linking with my existing portfolio website to avoid refactoring it (quite extensive @ www.dishdesign.com).

## Notes about Form vs Function (or Beauty vs Utility)

A fair amount of leeway was taken with this project's criteria given the nature of the graphic design industry. Designers are expected to be visual creatures, for better and worse. A web portfolio for an application engineer or full-stack developer needs to communicate very different things to potential employers (or employees!) than a portfolio for a visual designer.

I would argue this comes from the millenia-old duality between Form and Function (or Beauty and Utility, in more Greek terms.) One persistently negative cultural attitude since antiquity has held that those things which are functional need not be beautiful, and that in fact, to superadd Beauty to many engineered things is to waste resources and reduce efficiencies.

As a designer, I would argue quite the opposite: that Beauty (or at least a clear aesthetic agenda) can never really be "added" as a sheen or outer coating to anything because its true source is always within. The Eiffel Tower is a good example of an object that is much beloved despite being essentially useless, highly engineered, and considered crude and ugly for decades after it was built. But it serves a purpose nontheless of capturing and symbolizing the imagination, hopes, and dreams of an entire nation.

While 'beauty' as a concept is highly contested and subjective territory, the links below to 'brutalism' in web design perhaps get us to the heart of the question more easily. While many people would consider most brutalist web projects downright ugly (and intentionally so), many proponents praise the brutalist insistence on honesty in materials and lack of guise in leading reader/users to content in forced linear ways.

Displaying a clear and compelling aesthetic that is coupled with technical execution at the fine granular detail level is quite literally why visual designers are hired and a big part of what they bring to the table in a team setting. Hence, the following liberties were taken in breaking from the Demo target screenshot provided for this project:
* writing of the homepage copy about Experience rather than a dry resume overview statement
* mobile-first full-screen menu overlay interface instead of a typical top navbar with links
* visual effects and animations that are invisible to accessibility screen readers and unfortunately deprive those visitors with disabilities from the full interface experience (but this is sadly universal.)

* [Brutalist Websites:](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) websites that share a common attitude toward raw and relatively 'unmanipulated' content presentation techniques. The hand of the designer does not so forcefully guide the viewer in brutalist designs but rather creates more open-ended visual systems that can be interpreted and explored in multiple ways. The burden of formulating a mental map of the content and its intent is deferred to the viewer / user.
